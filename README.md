# field-extensions
field extensions in Isabelle/HOL (interdisciplinary project), based on isabelle-dev.
The theories in VectorSpace_by_HoldenLee stem from https://devel.isa-afp.org/entries/VectorSpace.html and
https://devel.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Jordan_Normal_Form/Missing_VectorSpace.html. I have slightly
adjusted them to better use the new HOL-Algebra.
