the examples from the lecture notes are not that important

isabelle mkroot

**Problems**

Duplicate fact declaration "Examples.rsr.add.finprod_one" vs. "Examples.rsr.add.finprod_one"\<^here>
The above error(s) occurred while activating locale instance
rsr.add :
  Group.comm_monoid
    "\<lparr>carrier = carrier (standard_ring (range rat_of_int)), monoid.mult = (\<oplus>\<^bsub>standard_ring (range rat_of_int)\<^esub>),
        one = \<zero>\<^bsub>standard_ring (range rat_of_int)\<^esub>\<rparr>"

^This error means that I have no way of seeing whether field_extension is correct --> Ask Manuel
Can the context-command use for-clauses to rename the variables? Or maybe rewrite-clauses are for that?

How to simplify facts during interpretation or locale definition?
