move the subgoals as lemmas into a context 'assumes "basis B"'

koordinatenfunktional ~> projection

-------
Presentation:

to keep track of subproofs, solve simple ones automatically

better examples of vector spaces

clarify contribution

field extension:
shorten explanation

use Q(root of 3)/Q as example

What did I do?
definitions
nontrivial results
(indexed product), afterwards problems (e.g. missing lemmas?)
isomorphism of adjoined root(, to this end: polynomials over a field form a euclidean domain)

mention how many lines were needed

What are the results?

**What does it look like in HOL-Algebra?**

HOL-Algebra:
What does it look like? Example
Maybe mention HOL-Computational_Algebra

mention Problems later
Problems?
"wir entscheiden uns fÃ¼r eine Basis" ~> fix B assume "basis B". Right?
subspace imports and argument order

conclusion:
Was it painfull?
next steps
personal opinion
(What could be done better?)
comparison to other formalisations

move technical stuff towards the end

--------------
documentation:

no proofs, but definitions and theorems
environment tabbing maybe (if Isabelle document is not pretty enough?)
Why this way and not differently
(maybe move the stuff from README.md here?)
