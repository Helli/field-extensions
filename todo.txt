move the subgoals as lemmas into a context 'assumes "basis B"'

koordinatenfunktional ~> projection

-------
Presentation:

motivational example: polynomial equations of degree five or more cannot be solved using root
expressions
disclaimer: I won't get so far

remove note about proof text markup?

remove "coloring" (i.e. note about coloring?)

to keep track of subproofs, solve simple ones automatically

What are the results?

**What does it look like in HOL-Algebra?**

HOL-Algebra:
What does it look like? Example
Maybe mention HOL-Computational_Algebra

mention Problems later
Problems?
"wir entscheiden uns fÃ¼r eine Basis" ~> fix B assume "basis B". Right?
subspace imports and argument order
