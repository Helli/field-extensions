move the subgoals as lemmas into a context 'assumes "basis B"'

clarify which stuff was added to the VectorSpace theories

**Questions**

Why are the current locales (e.g. subgroup) so conservative in importing other locales? Are there
good reasons for that?

After proving an interpretation of ring:
Duplicate fact declaration "Examples.rsr.add.finprod_one" vs. "Examples.rsr.add.finprod_one"\<^here>
The above error(s) occurred while activating locale instance
rsr.add :
  Group.comm_monoid
    "\<lparr>carrier = carrier (standard_ring (range rat_of_int)), monoid.mult = (\<oplus>\<^bsub>standard_ring (range rat_of_int)\<^esub>),
        one = \<zero>\<^bsub>standard_ring (range rat_of_int)\<^esub>\<rparr>"

How to simplify facts during interpretation or locale definition? Via "notes" clauses I think.
