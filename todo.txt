move the subgoals as lemmas into a context 'assumes "basis B"'

koordinatenfunktional ~> projection

-------
Presentation:

clarify contribution

What did I do?
definitions
(indexed product), afterwards problems (e.g. missing lemmas?)
isomorphism of adjoined root(, to this end: polynomials over a field form a euclidean domain)

mention how many lines were needed

What are the results?

**What does it look like in HOL-Algebra?**

HOL-Algebra:
What does it look like? Example (:?)
lemma (in cring) subring_cring: "subring S R ⟹ cring (R⦇carrier:=S⦈)"
using cring.subcringI' is_cring ring_axioms ring.subcring_iff subringE(1) by blast
Maybe mention HOL-Computational_Algebra

Problems?
"wir entscheiden uns für eine Basis" ~> fix B assume "basis B". Right?
(subspace imports and argument order)

conclusion:
Was it painful?
next steps
personal opinion
(What could be done better?) Quickcheck setup: some examples of rings which are not domains etc...
comparison to other formalisations

move technical stuff towards the end

--------------
documentation:

no proofs, but definitions and theorems
environment tabbing maybe (if Isabelle document is not pretty enough?)
Why this way and not differently
(maybe move the stuff from README.md here?)
