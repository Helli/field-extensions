vector space needs a second section
move more observations out of Examples.thy?

What did I do?
definitions
(indexed product), afterwards problems (e.g. missing lemmas?)
isomorphism of adjoined root(, to this end: polynomials over a field form a euclidean domain)

HOL-Algebra:
What does it look like? Example (:?)
lemma (in cring) subring_cring: "subring S R ⟹ cring (R⦇carrier:=S⦈)"
using cring.subcringI' is_cring ring_axioms ring.subcring_iff subringE(1) by blast
Maybe mention HOL-Computational_Algebra

conclusion:
next steps
personal opinion
(What could be done better?) Quickcheck setup: some examples of rings which are not domains etc...

documentation:

Why this way and not differently
(maybe move the stuff from README.md here?)
